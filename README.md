THis is Demo of showing that "Route","Switch",etc. components are not working with the current version of yarn v1.22.15 and current version of react i.e. react-router-dom version 6.0.1 is incompatible with current versions of yarn and react


To resolve this issue; downgrade the version of react-router-dom. I downgraded the version of react-router-dom to 5.3.0
